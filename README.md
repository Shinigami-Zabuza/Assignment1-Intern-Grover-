Code(Javafx) to create one-screen desktop-based application with some features. 

The screen has two input text fields on the center and one submit button.

Two Creative components also added ->
1. Added labels(like 'Textfield 1->') to mention/indicate the textfields to user (while still maintaing the textfields at the center of the screen).
2. Created a label named result which, when the submit button is pressed, concatenates 2 input strings(in textfields) and shows the result as labeltext.
